This project sets up The Handsomest Nerd, Inc.'s custom n8n environment with integrated Qdrant support, deployed via
GitHub Actions to Google Cloud Run.

## Features

- Custom Docker image with `curl`, `bash`, `nodejs`, and `firebase` installed.
- Environment variables for GitHub and CodeSandbox tokens.
- Automated deployment using GitHub Actions.
- Qdrant integration for vector search capabilities.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables.
3. Add required secrets to your GitHub repository.
4. Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger deployment.

## Access

Once deployed, access your n8n instance via the URL provided by Google Cloud Run.

# The Handsomest Nerd, Inc. AI Checklist

1. Finalize Vending Machine UI
   Description: Ensure that the React-based vending machine interface is fully functioning and can accept user inputs
   for the prompt and payment.

   Checklist:

   - [ ] Ensure React components for user input and display are correctly structured.

   - [ ] Integrate payment processing (Firebase or other solution).

   - [ ] Validate that the workflow is triggered upon payment.

2. Implement Passwordless Login System
   Description: Complete the passwordless authentication flow using Firebase. The system should only allow certain email
   addresses for added security.

   Checklist:

   - [ ] Set up Firebase Authentication for passwordless login (email link).

   - [ ] Implement email whitelisting to restrict access.

   - [ ] Test the login flow and ensure it links correctly to user sessions.

3. Connect Vending Machine UI to Firebase Backend
   Description: Ensure the Vending Machine UI sends data to Firebase, triggering the correct workflows once the user
   submits the prompt and payment.

   Checklist:

   - [ ] Set up Firebase Functions to handle prompt and payment data.

   - [ ] Ensure the workflow orchestrator in Firebase is triggered by this data.

4. Develop Workflow Orchestrator (n8n)
   Description: The n8n workflow orchestrator should be able to handle incoming prompts from the vending machine and
   trigger the generation of the React app.

   Checklist:

   - [ ] Ensure n8n is properly connected to Firebase to receive data.

   - [ ] Develop workflows to handle different aspects of the project: generating prompts, creating a scaffolded React app, and
routing to deployment options.

   - [ ] Test workflows with sample inputs.

5. Create React App Scaffold from Workflow
   Description: Upon receiving the prompt, the workflow orchestrator (n8n) should generate a React app scaffold based on
   the user's specifications.

   Checklist:

   - [ ] Set up the scaffold template that n8n will use to create the React app.

   - [ ] Integrate GPT (or another AI model) to dynamically generate React code based on the input prompt.

   - [ ] Test React app generation with different inputs.

6. Integrate Deployment Options (CodeSandbox & GitHub)
   Description: Ensure that the generated React app can be deployed either to CodeSandbox for preview or GitHub for full
   access.

   Checklist:

   - [ ] Set up automated deployment to CodeSandbox from n8n.

   - [ ] Integrate a GitHub push from n8n to store the final code in a userâ€™s repository.

   - [ ] Ensure CodeSandbox provides an editable preview while GitHub provides full access.

7. Set Up In-Browser VS Code for App Customization
   Description: Provide users the option to edit their generated app directly in their browser via VS Code integration.

   Checklist:

   - [ ] Configure a code-server or similar service in a container to allow for VS Code access directly in the browser.

   - [ ] Integrate the VS Code environment into the vending machine UI.

   - [ ] Ensure that users can edit and save changes to their React app in the VS Code instance.

8. Integrate Payment Gateway for Workflow Access
   Description: Ensure that the GitHub access button is behind a paywall, while CodeSandbox access remains free.

Checklist:

   - [ ] Integrate a payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) for the GitHub deployment option.

   - [ ] Ensure payments are processed before users can access GitHub deployment.

   - [ ] Test the payment flow and button visibility based on user payment status.

9. Final Testing & Validation
   Description: Test all components together to ensure smooth operation of the vending machine, authentication, workflow
   orchestration, code generation, and deployment.

Checklist:

   - [ ] Test the entire process from prompt submission to React app deployment.

   - [ ] Test edge cases (invalid input, no payment, etc.).

   - [ ] Validate payment flow, login flow, and deployment options.

10. Document the Process for Future Reference
    Description: Write documentation for the entire system, including setup instructions, API endpoints, and workflow
    steps.

Checklist:

   - [ ] Write README for the repo that explains the overall architecture.

   - [ ] Document Firebase Function setup, workflow creation in n8n, and React app generation.

   - [ ] Provide API reference for communication between the vending machine UI, Firebase, and n8n.

11. Deploy to Production Environment
    Description: Once everything is tested and validated, deploy the system to a production environment.

Checklist:

   - [ ] Set up cloud hosting (Firebase, AWS, etc.) for production deployment.

   - [ ] Set up production environment variables (API keys, tokens, etc.).

   - [ ] Deploy the complete application, ensuring scalability and reliability.

ðŸŒŸ Future Add-ons & Enhancements
AI Integration: Implement more advanced AI for personalized code generation, feedback, and app improvements.

User Accounts: Allow users to save their generated apps, track their usage, and have access to their code across
sessions.

Collaboration Features: Allow users to collaborate on app development directly within the VS Code environment or in the
app.
